			<h3>We discover potential, build bridges, develop solutions, and most importantly create chemistry with consumers.</h3>
			<p>If you are reading this, you're probably wondering what we can offer your credit union or maybe you are family (Hi Mom!). We help our clients with brand strategy, product launches, campaign development, website design, guerilla marketing, viral videos, infographics, and all kinds of other cool things. Lists are great, but here's what we think is important: </p>
			<p><strong>WE DISCOVER</strong> what's truly important to the people you serve. We find ways to make your brand more memorable, more relevant and unique to make your communication most effective. </p>
			<p><strong>WE LISTEN</strong> to our clients' big dreams. In turn they often become friends. Then, we make it our mission to help those big dreams come true. We put our all into making our clients successful. Afterall, there is no greater joy than see people you care about succeed. </p>
			<p><strong>WE DEVELOP</strong> solutions.  Bring us your scariest nightmare, and we can help you solve it. In fact, our favorite work has been when the odds were stacked against us.</p>
			<p><strong>WE BUILD</strong> bridges. We believe collaboration is the only way to get the best result. Often birthing a mutual baby inspires even the staunchest critic.</p>
			<p><strong>WE CREATE</strong> chemistry with consumers. We believe that honoring your members, keying into the right emotion and making it all unique is what creates results.</p>

		</header>

		<div class="inner">

			<h3>We believe our clients are so much greater than they know. It's an honor to help them discover this about themselves.</h3>
			<p>Everyone is called to do something. We all want to make earning a paycheck into something grander than ourselves. We help others discover this potential. </p>
			 
			<p>As former credit union marketers, we get it. We feel the pressure when it comes to growing loans, gaining members, sitting in ALCO meetings (yawn), and becoming the designated front-line cheerleaders. We understand the battle with lending, the arm wrestling match with compliance, the joy of birthing new ideas - and we get amped by all of it. It's a strange love affair, but we adore the art 	and challenge of credit union marketing. For this reason, we left the comfort and safety of our former credit unions and set out on a journey to help others shine.</p>
			 
			<p>We aren't lifesavers or know-it-alls. To be completely honest, we even dislike wearing suits and sitting in meetings. We simply happen to be good at what we were called to do - helping credit unions stand taller by creating chemistry with consumers. We do it through highly creative and focused ideas, tested strategies, and understanding and honoring people. </p>
			 
			<p>This is why we are gira{ph}.</p>

			<h2>Simple, Powerful Web Content<br>
				Management for Credit Unions</h2>
		
		</div>
		
		<div class="wrap">
			<div class="inner">
				<p>As former Credit Union Marketers, we have first-hand experience with the best and worst in web content management systems - from clunky, inflexible admin tools to mammoth fees for hosting and service to contracts that handcuff credit unions to vendors for years.</p>
				<p>This is why we built phormula - an easy to use , affordable, ridiculously flexible content management system that makes it super simple for credit unions to update content, and make the most of the web experience for members.</p>
				<p><strong>Here's what we love about it:</strong></p>
				<p><strong>It's Flexible.</strong><br>
				You'll be able to update just about anything. Change every photo, promotion, rate, and page. Plus, each admin tool is built uniquely for the credit union.</p>
				<p><strong>It's Intuitive.</strong><br>
				You won't need a degree in Computer Engineering. It's beautifully designed to be simple and easy on the user.</p>
				<p><strong>It's Affordable.</strong><br>
				No long term contracts. No outrageous hosting fees. You will be able to take the money you are currently spending on web hosting and servicing and put it right back into doing great work for your members.</p>
				<p><strong>It's Custom Built.</strong><br>
				We build each site custom to each credit union based on what's important to your members and your brand.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="box">
				<p><strong>It has features you wont find anywhere else.</strong><br>
				As bonafide credit union nerds, we built in features we thought were cool and hope you will too.</p>
				<p>Show members how much they can save on auto loans, visa credit cards, and personal loans by financing them with you. We've built calculators using your rates and compare them to the competition to show the actual savings your members can expect. Intuitively built into your pages, you can not only tell your members how you can help them, you can show them too.</p>
				<p>We've also built an ATM and Service Center locator that's part of your website, not a link to a 3rd party. This way members see your credit union as part of a large branching system without having to experience a pop-up with a big warning they are leaving the credit union to go to another site.</p>

				<h3>Crossing Monkey Bars</h3>
				<p>I'll admit I have a hard time letting go. I seem to attach sentimental value to nearly everything and everyone in my life.  I see it happen so often in credit unions too. We hold on so tightly to our old ways, the people that no longer fit our culture, and our favorite security blanket, the status quo. Perhaps it's because credit union people by and large are kind-hearted, forgiving, and sentimenal souls. But letting go is an essential prerequisite to moving forward with just about anything worthwhile.</p>

				<h3>We have spoken at credit union events all over the country about branding, marketing, creativity, authencity coopetition and advocacy. Below are a few of our favorite topics to speak about.</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="inner group">
				
				<div class="presentation">
					<h3>Beyond Silverware:<br>
					Innovative ideas you can put in place now</h3>
					<p>During this session,we will share how to make the most of a marketing budget during these tough economic times by investing in differentiation combined with guerilla marketing as the secret weapons to develop your own super hero marketing powers. In this session, you'll discover how some simple low cost, out- of-the-box ideas can gain attention to get Results with a capital R.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="presentation">
					<h3>Mastering the Art of Coopetition</h3>
					<p>Coopetition in the credit union movement is a term that encompasses how credit unions can still exhibit the values of a cooperative while also competing for market share with other credit unions. As more credit unions are becoming community chartered their fields of membership have and will continue to overlap. This session will discuss marketing strategies that will allow your credit union to cooperate with other credit unions to expand the movement but also compete for our individual piece of the market.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="presentation">
					<h3>What are your ingredients?<br>
					It's time to discover and differentiate</h3>
					<p>Branding includes all the emotions that people have about your credit union. And unfortunately, if you do not actively create and reinforce your brand image, your members will craft one for you. Now more than ever, credit unions have extra challenges from a limited staff, budgets and resources. Having the discipline to stop being all things to all people, but instead being amazing things to just the right people is the focus of this idea lab. You'll walk away with some implementable ideas for your credit union on how to connect, engage and build the right community for your members.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="presentation last">
					<h3>Integrating Advocacy into Your Marketing</h3>
					<p>Most credit union employees, volunteers, members, and potential members are aware of the increased role the government will play in the financial services industry as more regulations are introduced. While your league and CUNA are continually working for the credit union and it's members to insure these regulations will be beneficial, what role should the credit union's marketing play in promoting advocacy. Find out how advocacy can be integrated into your marketing strategy.</p>
